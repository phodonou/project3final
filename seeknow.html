    <strong>Problem: </strong>
    <p>A lot of people are intimidated by learning new topics because they think it’s ‘too hard’ or ‘they’re not
        smart
        enough’. The problem isn’t because its ‘too hard’. It’s because their teaching source doesn’t match their
        learning style.</p>
