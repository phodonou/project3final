        <p>Flutter allows you to build beautiful native apps on iOS and Android from a single codebase.</p>
        <p> <strong>Fast Development:</strong> Paint your app to life in milliseconds with stateful Hot Reload. Use a
            rich
            set of fully-customizable widgets to build native interfaces in minutes.</p>
        <p> <strong>Expressive and Flexible UI</strong>Quickly ship features with a focus on native end-user
            experiences.
            Layered architecture allows for full customization, which results in incredibly fast rendering and
            expressive
            and flexible designs.</p>
        <p> <strong>Native Performance</strong> Flutter’s widgets incorporate all critical platform differences such as
            scrolling, navigation, icons and fonts to provide full native performance on both iOS and Android.</p>

        <h2>React</h2>

        <p>A JavaScript library for building user interfaces</p>
        <p> <strong>Declarative</strong> React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for
            each
            state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your
            data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.</p>
        <p> <strong>Component-Based</strong> Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose
            them
            to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily
            pass
            rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.</p>
        <p> <strong>Learn Once, Write Anywhere</strong> It doesn't make assumptions about the rest of your technology
            stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on
            the
            server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native</p>

        <h2>Dart Programming Language</h2>
        <img src="itm_pic/dart.png" alt="" height="300" width="600">
        <p>Developers at Google and elsewhere use Dart to create high-quality, mission-critical apps for iOS, Android,
            and
            the web. With features aimed at client-side development, Dart is a great fit for both mobile and web apps.</p>
        <p> <strong>Productive</strong> Dart’s syntax is clear and concise, its tooling simple yet powerful. Sound
            typing
            helps you to identify subtle errors early. Dart has battle-hardened core libraries and an ecosystem of
            thousands of packages. </p>
        <p> <strong>Fast</strong> Dart provides optimizing ahead-of-time compilation to get predictably high
            performance
            and fast startup across mobile devices and the web. </p>
        <p> <strong>Portable</strong> Dart compiles to ARM and x86 code, so that Dart mobile apps can run natively on
            iOS,
            Android, and beyond. For web apps, Dart transpiles to JavaScript. </p>
        <p> <strong>Approachable</strong> Dart is familiar to many existing developers, thanks to its unsurprising
            object
            orientation and syntax. If you already know C++, C#, or Java, you can be productive with Dart in just a few
            days. </p>
        <p> <strong>Reactive</strong> Dart is well-suited to reactive programming, with support for managing
            short-lived
            objects—such as UI widgets—through Dart’s fast object allocation and generational garbage collector. Dart
            supports asynchronous programming through language features and APIs that use Future and Stream objects.
